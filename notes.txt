onblur = triggered when the element loses focus (will be effective if the user
is on the home account page)

onfocus = when the user is redirected to the malicious site and the user
clicks on the login form, utilize onfocus to trigger some sort of possible
injecting keylogger, or maybe get ip address.


onmouseover = we can implement an add on the website. When the user puts his
mouse over the add, the tabnabbing script can be executed. Possible attack
vector. May or may not work, the function call may have to explicit from the
trusted host. The only way this would work is if user clicks on the website.
